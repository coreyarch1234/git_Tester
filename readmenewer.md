### 1. Are some infinities bigger than others?
	Yes

    Trevin's Answer: Yes, because some things are just bigger than the others. Maybe this is just too deep but it works. 

Eric's Answer: Yes some infinities are bigger than other infinities in that they are further along in their never ending path. The nature of inifinity only implies that it is neveredning.
